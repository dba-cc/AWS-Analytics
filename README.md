# Infra-Management Console
The Infra-Management Console is a management system for on-premise Microsoft SQL Server. The front-end is developed in AngularJS and the API is developed in C#.

## Contents
This repository contains the following files and folders:

* MSUIS View: This folder contains the front-end of the project.
* MSUISApi: This folder contains the API required for the project.
* DBAdmin.bak: This file is a Microsoft SQL Server backup file that contains all of the stored procedures used to fetch data from the SQL Server.

## Usage
To use the Infra-Management Console, you will need to restore the DBAdmin.bak file to your Microsoft SQL Server. Once the database is restored, you can then deploy the front-end and API to your server.
